## Time- and momentum-resolved phonon population dynamics

In this work we provide a description of the signals contained in ultrafast electron diffuse scattering (UEDS) measurements and a comprehensive and broadly applicable computational method for UEDS data reduction based on density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). Specifically, we present a procedure to recover phonon population dynamics as a function of the phonon branch and wavevector, and a determination of wavevector-dependent (or mode-projected) electron-phonon coupling constants from those phonon population measurements. The application of this approach to the case of photodoped carriers in the Dirac cones of thin graphite is demonstrated. The electron-phonon coupling strength to the strongly-coupled $A_1'$ phonon at the K-point of the Brillouin zone, and the nonequilibrium optical and acoustic phonon branch populations as a function of time following excitation across the whole Brillouin zone are all determined from the UEDS measurements.

## Non-equilibrium phases in photo-excited VO~2~

At excitation density values lower than that required to initiate the monoclinic to rutile phase transition, vanadium dioxide undergoes a reorganization of unit cell charge which stabilizes a meta-stable metallic phase. This _monoclinic metallic_ phase of vanadium dioxide is depicted in the figure below showing a slice of a Fourier re-constructed volume. The phase demonstrates a charge modulation along the rutile __c__ axis occurring on the Oxygen atoms closest to Vanadium atoms and the fluence dependence of the phase formation time suggests that the rate is governed by the energy deposited into the election system through and activated kinetic process.

## Non-equilibrium phonon dynamics with ultrafast electron diffuse scattering

Despite their fundamental role in determining material properties, detailed momentum-dependent information on the strength of electron-phonon and phonon-phonon coupling has proved difficult to obtain. Ultrafast electron diffuse scattering provides the answers.

By exploiting symmetry-based selection rules and time-resolution, scattering from different phonon branches can be distinguished even without energy resolution. Using graphite as a model system, we show that ultrafast electron diffuse scattering (UEDS) patterns map the relative electron-phonon coupling (EPC) and phonon-phonon coupling (PPC) strength through their profound sensitivity to photoinduced changes in phonon populations. We measure strong EPC to the $K$-point transverse optical phonon of $A_1′$ symmetry and along the entire longitudinal optical branch between $\Gamma$-$K$, not only to the $\Gamma$-$E_{2g}$ phonon as previously emphasized. We also determine that the subsequent phonon relaxation pathway involves three stages; decay via several identifiable channels to transverse acoustic (TA) and longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonons (1-2 ps), intraband thermalization of the non-equilibrium TA/LA phonon populations (30-40 ps) and interband relaxation of the LA/TA modes (115 ps). Combining UEDS with ultrafast angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy will yield a complete picture of the dynamics within and between electron and phonon subsystems, helping to unravel complex phases in which the intertwined nature of these systems have a strong influence on emergent properties[1].

## Strongly-correlated materials physics: photoinduced phase transitions in VO~2~

At 67°C the conductivity of vanadium dioxide exhibits a discontinuous jump of as much as 5-orders of magnitude between the lower temperature semiconducting and the higher temperature metallic phases.

The microscopic mechanism for this metal-insulator transition (MIT) in VO~2~ has been the subject of profound controversy, and our understanding of the structural and electronic peculiarities of the metallic and insulating phases in VO~2~ is profoundly incomplete despite decades of work. The long-standing challenge to understanding the MIT has been to determine the relative role of electron-lattice interactions (lattice and charge order) and electron-electron interactions (dynamical correlations and orbital selection) to the change in properties and the nature of the low temperature semiconducting phase. In this respect the MIT in VO~2~ forms a benchmark problem in condensed matter physics, since it requires parsing the roles of competing/collaborating instabilities that conspire to determine the emergent properties of a material.

By combining the group's dynamic materials characterization methods (RF-compressed UED and broadband mid-IR reflectivity) we recently uncovered hidden connections between electronic properties and structural degrees of freedom along the optically-induced non-equilibrium pathway between phases in VO~2~[1]. The combined approach made it possible to map the reorganization of the VO~2~ unit cell during the optically induced transition while simultaneously determining electronic properties. The results demonstrated - at low excitation fluence - a photoinduced phase transition to a long-lived state with metal-like mid-IR optical properties, but the lattice/charge-order of the semiconducting M1 phase intact. This metastable state differs from the equilibrium rutile metal crystallographically and in that it only involves a 1D reorganization of charge density rather than a transition to the isotropic 3D electronic state of the high temperature phase. The dramatic separation of the insulator-to-metal transition from the structural phase trasition that is coincident when the process is thermally activated was unexpected, and is a clear indication that the low-temperature semiconducting phase of VO~2~ cannot be understood by conventional band theory (electron-lattice interactions alone). The gigantic photoresponse in the mid-IR is also clear evidence that electronic correlations determine the properties of the semiconducting phases, and is a phenomena that is intriguing for applications.

This work demonstrates that UED can provide deep insights into the nature of strongly correlated materials through the disparate responses of active degrees of freedom in the time domain. Further, UED can be used to study the interplay between valence charge and lattice structure in molecular and materials chemistry. The ability to separate photoinduced changes to lattice structure and charge density is a new capability that the group seeks to explore further.

## Coherent and incoherent electron-phonon coupling in graphite

The unique electronic properties of graphite, graphene, and carbon nanotubes have inspired a great deal of attention for both fundamental and practical reasons, with the hope that these materials will enable high performance carbon based electronic devices.

<div class="columns">
<div class="column is-three-fifths">
In graphite and graphene, these properties emerge from the nature of the electron-lattice interactions in the highly anisotropic crystal structure; strong, covalently bound hexagonal sheets of carbon atoms (graphene) that are each weakly bound together to form the layered structure of graphite. The Siwick group has employed Radio-frequency compressed ultrafast electron diffraction to interrogate the nature of the electron-lattice interactions in graphite directly from the perspective of the lattice degrees of freedom.

Specifically, we probed the coherent and incoherent coupling of impulsive electronic excitation at 1.55 eV (800 nm) to optical and acoustic phonon modes in single-crystal graphite samples using time-resolved electron crystallography[1]. These experiments yielded rich data sets exhibiting Bragg peak intensity suppression, intensity modulation, spot position modulation and spot position shifts that were characteristic of particular lattice excitations.

A biexponential suppression of diffracted intensity due to relaxation of the electronic system into incoherent phonons is observed through the Debye-Waller effect, with the 250 fs fast contribution dominated by coupling to the E2g2 optical phonon mode at the Γ point and A01 optical phonon mode at the K point. Both modes have Kohn anomalies at these points in the Brillouin zone. The result is a unique non-equilibrium state with the electron subsystem in thermal equilibrium with only a very small subset of the lattice degrees of freedom within 500 fs following photoexcitation. This state relaxes through further electron-phonon and phonon-phonon pathways. In addition, electronic excitation leads to both in-plane and out-of-plane coherent lattice responses in graphite whose character we are able to fully determine. The in-plane motion is specifically a Γ point shearing mode of the graphene planes and the out-of-plane motion an acoustic breathing mode response of the very thin (<100 nm) crystal.

These results demonstrate that we can precisely identify lattice responses following photoexcitation in k,ω space, and that this can be accomplished with great sensitivity. The observed inter-layer shear amplitude is approximately 70 times the radius of a proton! More generally, these results highlight the enhanced time resolution and sensitivity provided by RF compressed UED and its ability to probe the fastest and most fundamental structural dynamics in material systems.

## Dynamic transmission electron microscopy of explosive crystallization in amorphous germanium 

Crystallization of amorphous germanium (a-Ge) initiated by laser or electron beam heating is a remarkably complex and technologically relevant process that involves several distinct modes of crystal growth and the development of intricate microstructural patterns on ns-to-μs time scales.

The Siwick group and collaborators at Lawrence Livermore National Lab and INRS-EMT (Quebec) have used dynamic transmission electron microscopy (DTEM) to study the fast, complex crystallization dynamics with 10 nm spatial and 15 ns temporal resolution, sufficient to follow the microstructural evolution in great detail[1]. With the unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution provided by DTEM, we have obtained time-resolved real-space images of nanosecond laser-induced crystallization in a-Ge. We were able to watch the process of nanocrystallization (nucleation and growth) in the laser-illuminated region (Zone I) as it occurs over the first ~300 ns, and directly visualize the subsequent evolution of the explosive crystallization front that propagates radially outwards from this region at speeds of up to ~16 m/s (Zone II). These images enabled the experimental determination of the complete interface response function for explosive crystallization in aGe.

This radial growth is followed by an abrupt transition to a qualitatively distinct ledge-like growth mechanism that produces a layered microstructure (Zone III) on a time scale of several microseconds. The crystallization in this region actually proceeds azimuthally, not radially, with the layered structure forming in a zig-zag manner through the interleaving of the azimuthally grown layers. This growth mode was completely unexpected and not in keeping with earlier suggestions.

These studies provided essential insights into the mechanisms governing this complex crystallization, providing a new view of the underlying processes and mechanisms. Most of the crystallization dynamics are driven by the exothermic nature of the crystallization itself (the laser only initiates the transformation) and emerges through the subtle interplay of kinetics and thermodynamics. Overall, the work is a dramatic demonstration of the power of DTEM for studying time-dependent material processes far from equilibrium.
