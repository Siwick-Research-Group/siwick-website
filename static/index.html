    The group's activities are directed towards the development and application of new methods to directly observe the 
    time-evolving structure of matter at the level of atomic-scale structural rearrangements in the unit cell.

            The methods we are developing combine electron microscopes (designed and built in-house) 
            with femtosecond pulsed lasers in novel ways. Our goal is to push time resolution to the sub-100 fs timescale, below 
            that of a typical phonon period. By doing so, atomic motion is essentially frozen during an observation and we can follow all the 
            fundamental dynamics to produce a "molecular movie"; the experimental equivalent of a molecular dynamics simulation. We hope to 
            determine the structure and properties of material and molecular systems far from equilibrium with the precision we are accustomed 
            to for systems near equilibrium.

            Such studies will provide important details of the changes in configuration as systems evolve along 
            some pathway between two stable equilibrium structures or phases. This kind of information is essential for understanding chemical 
            reaction dynamics at a deep level (from small molecules to proteins), phase transition dynamics &mdash; both more standard phase 
            transitions, and new exotic classes of so-called "photoinduced" phase transitions where photoexcitation provides a means to 
            access novel phases of matter with electronic, structural, or magnetic order that are inaccessible by conventional routes.
